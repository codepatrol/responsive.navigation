responsive.navigation - possible to close subMenu
=================================================

This implements a mobile accordion-navigation without any JavaScript.

## example
See <a href="http://cdpn.io/Ipwrz" target="_blank">example on codepen</a>. Please note that the codepen-code isn't
the same as here. Codepen needed some minor changes.

## browser support
Similar to master, but subMenu can be closed in all Browsers which understand sibling-selector <code>~</code>.
